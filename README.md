Very much work in progress but now these bits of scripts do:

	- VPC creation
	- Security groups
	- Create IAM Instance Profiles and Roles for Baking an AMI and for running an instance from that AMI

TODO:

	- Fix the AMI bake step
	- Create an ASG from the AMI
	- Create some example hello world deployment with CodeDeploy
